## About
A curated set of Python examples and small projects to help learners practice common programming concepts and algorithms.

## What you'll find
- Beginner exercises (variables, conditionals, loops, functions)
- Data structures (lists, dicts, sets, tuples)
- Algorithms and problem-solving examples
- Small projects and scripts (file I/O, web scraping, automation)

## Getting started
1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/codderpranav/python.git
2. Navigate into the folder and run scripts with Python 3.x, for example:
   python3 examples/hello_world.py

## Project layout
- examples/         # runnable example scripts
- tests/            # basic tests (pytest)
- README.md         # this file
- LICENSE           # project license

## Running the example
From the repository root:

python3 examples/hello_world.py

Or run the test suite (requires pytest):

pip install -r requirements.txt || true
pytest -q

## Testing
A minimal pytest test is included in tests/ that verifies the example script's helper function.
